    <h2>Biography</h2>
    <p>
      Dr. Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar, affectionately known as Babasaheb Ambedkar, was one of the most influential figures in modern Indian history. Born on April 14, 1891, in Mhow, Madhya Pradesh, he rose from humble beginnings to become a towering intellectual, a fierce advocate for social justice, and a key architect of independent India.

      Despite facing severe caste-based discrimination throughout his life, Ambedkar pursued education with unwavering determination. He earned doctorates in economics from Columbia University and the London School of Economics, becoming one of the most educated Indians of his time. His academic brilliance was matched by his deep commitment to uplifting the marginalized and oppressed communities of India.

      As a social reformer, Ambedkar led movements to eradicate untouchability and fought for the rights of Dalits and other disadvantaged groups. He believed that true democracy could only be achieved through equality, education, and the annihilation of caste. His writings, speeches, and activism laid the foundation for a more inclusive and just society.

      In 1947, Ambedkar was appointed as the first Law Minister of independent India and was entrusted with the monumental task of drafting the Indian Constitution.

His vision continues to guide India's democratic principles and legal framework.
